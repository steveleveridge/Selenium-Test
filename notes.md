# Selenium-Test
BDD framework example using Ruby

Setup project using Testgen gem
Example of BDD, not all test coverage is shown, can add more tests if needed
Shows the use of background scenario & regular expression
Config.yml can be added if multiple test envs are needed along with additional rake tasks added to cucumber.yml
Happy to write some API tests on another repo if needed to check status and response on the GET calls made on the button
